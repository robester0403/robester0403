## Hi everyone 
This is the place where I store my coding explorations, and ~~attempt to~~ disrupt the status quo!

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on a collaborative project and websites for other professionals
ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning React Native and python
ðŸ’¬  Ask me about Javascript/Typescript/ or /React/Express/Node
ðŸ“«  How to reach me: Through my LinkedIn below!
âš¡  Fun fact: I love slow cooked smoked BBQ and helping other professionals to start coding!
