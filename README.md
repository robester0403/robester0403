## Hi everyone 
This is the place where I store my coding explorations, and ~~attempt to~~ disrupt the status quo!

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on a collaborative project and websites for other professionals  
ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently polishing up my AWS and finishing my portfolio  
ðŸ’¬  Ask me about Javascript/Typescript or /React/Express/Node  
ðŸ“«  How to reach me: Through my LinkedIn below!  
:meat_on_bone: Fun fact: I love slow cooked smoked BBQ and helping other professionals to start coding!
